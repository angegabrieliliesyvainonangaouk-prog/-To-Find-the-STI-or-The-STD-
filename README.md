# -To-Find-the-STI-or-The-STD-
My goal in this project is to discover, using many laboratory tests on a person, whether they are sick, have an infection, or are in good health. This is a mock dataset: I have used a dataset with 15,000 rows, created by AI, with around 10% of the values being NaN, to make it as close as possible to real conditions.
